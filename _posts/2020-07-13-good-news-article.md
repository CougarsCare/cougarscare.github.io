Mr. Urban and his Cougar Care cadre of students put together 100 boxes filled with non-perishables food items on Friday night, November 20, including all the Thanksgiving staples. They returned on Saturday morning to add fresh bread, fresh pies, and fresh vegetables. Truly a feast! Staff and volunteers added $10 gift cards from King Soopers to purchase a turkey or ham and helped the families in need by carrying their boxes to their cars or delivering them to their doorstep. Doing good feels good!
