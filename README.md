Edit Instructions:

General
- All of the various pages on the Cougars care site canbe accessed from the main page of the repo. This includes the Home page, About us, Apply for Aid, How to Help, and News pages along with the search(although this should not need much editing)

- They operate based off of a fairly simple text edit system and resources on md file management are available online. HTML code can also be used within the md files to embed images or other styles

- The News articles can be managed, editied, deleted, or created from the _posts folder and are also md files


Other Stuff
- Assets holds the images and various other file forms used throughout the site, images can be downloaded here and referenced elsewhere to be incorporated into the site

- The _sass folder contains all of the CSS and styling elements for the website, this is typically in the form of variables, font types, and formats, and it can be changed to alter these aspects of the site.
